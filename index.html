  <p>We found this adorable little pupper abandoned on the street
    in Indiranagar, Banglore. Some kids had taken her away from her mother to
    play, and then left her alone in a strange place. We took her to a vet and
    found her a temporary place to stay with a friend, but she urgently needs to find a
    loving home to call her own. She's sweet and friendly and about 80% ears. </p>

    <p>Eevee is a pupper type Pokemon that suddenly mutates due to the
      environment in which she lives. If given a loving home she will grow from
      a sweet little pupper to a loyal, friendly doggo.</p>
